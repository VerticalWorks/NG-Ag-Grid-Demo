<span>Greetings,</span>
You should hire me because I have the skills & experience to ensure your business
requirements are correctly captured, groomed, and implemented in a fashion that yields the best
implementation at the lowest cost with minimal friction. You should hire me if you need a dedicated
engineering resource that has years of experience architecting, designing, and building on-prem,
hybrid and cloud-based solutions on a remote basis.
My love and dedication for configuring, running, and tuning Scrum Teams-- using modern Agile Scrum
toolsâ€”is a strong value add to your company, teams, and products. I excel at working remotely with
full transparency, visibility, and accountability.
I bring years of experience to the table, yet, every day is a school day because change never stops in
IT. I always strive to make solid contributions to the team, and to help those that need it. I always have
fun on the job, because fun teams have the best chance at sustained success.
In conclusion, my resume contains the details, the technologies, and the projects of my career. My
excellent references will do all the boasting for me. I have details on every project, so feel free to ask
about them (the 10-page resume).
<p></p>
I hope to hear from you soon.
Thank you for your time,
<p></p>
